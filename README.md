# Hj Construction and Logistic Service Financial Analysis


I received data from Auditing department telling me to please help them Analyse the
financial statement of Hj Construction and Logistic Service.

I have been supplied with two vectors of data: 
Monthly revenue and monthly expenses for the year of 2021. 

My task is to calculate the following
financial metrics:

* profit for each month
* profit after tax for each month (the tax rate is 30%)
* profit margin for each month - equals to profit a after tax divided by revenue
* good months - where the profit after tax was greater than the mean for the year
* bad months - where the profit after tax was less than the mean for the year
* the best month - where the profit after tax was max for the year
* the worst month - where the profit after tax was min for the year.
